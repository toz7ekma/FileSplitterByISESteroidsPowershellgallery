      .SYNOPSIS
      Joins the parts created by Split-File and re-creates the original file
 
      .DESCRIPTION
      Use Split-File first to split a file into multiple part files with extension .part
      To join (recreate) the original file, specify the original file name (less the part number and the extension .part)
 
      .EXAMPLE
      Join-File -Path "C:\test.zip"
      Looks for the file c:\testzip.00.part and starts creating c:\test.zip from it. Once c:\test.zip.00.part is processed, it looks for more parts until
      no more parts are found.
 
      .EXAMPLE
      Join-File -Path "C:\test.zip" -DeletePartFiles
      Looks for the file c:\testzip.00.part and starts creating c:\test.zip from it. Once c:\test.zip.00.part is processed, it looks for more parts until
      no more parts are found.
      Once the original file c:\test.zip is recreated, all c:\test.zip.XXX.part files are deleted.
